# e-commerce-sample.io

Intro:

The main idea of this project is to build a sample e-commerce frontend with React. It's not supposed to have backend related features but I have the intention of working on a database to simulate stock management right after I'm done with the frontend.
I decided to work on this type of project because I've been involved in an e-commerce project before [If you are reading this, hi Daniel ;)]. The thing is, since there is no trace left about this project, I wanted to base the design of this sample on the web page of the previous project, but instead of using html, css and js I'll use React framework.

Current state:

So I initially wanted to develop this project using Angular, but after some research I've found React is more suitable for building this type of projects. Since I'm not deeply confident with any of these tools I suppose React being easier to work with will also help the process. For the moment I've removed every Angular file and I'll start uploading React work when I figure out how to properly do everything I have in mind.
